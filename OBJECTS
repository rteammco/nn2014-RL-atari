VisualProcessor has an option to detect the player controlled object.
    - This isn't detected with certainty.
    - May or may not be found.

Objects matched exactly.
    - Partially occluded objects are not identified.

Some objects are undetected in later levels of certain games.
    - Asterix, Beam Rider, Phoenix.

Substraits (object classes) are available, too.
    - Each class (Prototype) has a list of object IDs.

VisualProcessor also provides a raw downscaled pixel representation.
    - Reduces number of colors.
